You are provided with a JSON dataset of attractions. Each attraction includes a "categories" attribute. Your task is to summarize the "categories" into two concise attributes: "Attraction type" and "Perks".

Attraction Type: Summarize the main purpose or theme of the attraction using predefined categories following these rules:
* Such as Museums, Parks, Local Flavor, Landmarks & Historical Buildings, or other words mentioned in the dataset itself.

* Choose the most accurate and comprehensive word as the attraction type.

Perks: Highlight unique specialties or features of the attraction:
* "Jazz & Blues" for a specific vibe or musical setting.
* "Caribbean" for unique cuisine offerings.
* "Nightlife" for activities involving evening entertainment.
* Ensure the selected "perk" reflects the most representative specialty of the attraction.
* If the information is insufficient or cannot be summarized, output "Not Applicable" for the respective attribute.

Provide the output in the following JSON format:
----- Example starts -----
{
    "attraction_type":"xxxx",
    "perks":"xxx"
}
