**Day 1**

* **9:00 AM**: Start the day at the Philadelphia Museum of Art (4.5/5 stars), which is within walking distance of many hotels. The museum features an impressive collection of art and artifacts, including works by famous artists like Van Gogh and Monet.
* **12:00 PM**: Take a break for lunch at Pat's King of Steaks (3.0/5 stars), a classic Philly cheesesteak joint that's been serving up delicious sandwiches since 1930. Budget about $10-$15 per person.

For accommodations, I recommend staying at the Aloft Philadelphia Airport (2.5/5 stars), which offers clean and comfortable rooms at an affordable price of around $80-$100 per night. The hotel is located near the airport, but you can take a short Uber ride to get to the city center.
