Thought 1: To create a detailed travel itinerary for a 4-day trip with an expensive budget, I need to gather information about accommodations, attractions focused on shopping, Korean restaurants, and related business information to optimize routes. I'll start by searching for suitable accommodations that are of good quality and in a good location.
Action 1: AccommodationSearch[Expensive Budget,[Good Location, Good Quality]]
Observation 1:                                           Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.
Thought 2: I have collected suitable accommodations that are of good quality and in good locations. Next, I will search for shopping-oriented attractions that match the expensive budget specified.
Action 2: AttractionSearch[Expensive Budget,[Shopping Oriented]]
Observation 2:                                                             Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.
Thought 3: Now that I have gathered information about accommodations and shopping-oriented attractions, I need to find Korean restaurants that fit within the expensive budget and meet the preferences outlined in the query.
Action 3: RestaurantSearch[Expensive Budget,Korean,[Good Flavor, Good Value]]
Observation 3:                       Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.
Thought 4: I have obtained the necessary information about accommodations, shopping-oriented attractions, and Korean restaurants that meet the budget and preferences outlined. Next, I will compile a list of business clusters to optimize the arrangement of locations for each day of the trip.
