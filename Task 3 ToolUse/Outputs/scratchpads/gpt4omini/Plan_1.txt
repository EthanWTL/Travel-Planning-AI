Thought 1: To generate a well-organized travel itinerary for a 3-day trip focusing on cheap, activity-oriented attractions, Indian restaurants with good flavor and value, and accommodations in a good location, I will first gather information on each category: accommodation, attractions, and restaurants. I will also need to look into spatial clustering to optimize the route.
Action 1: AccommodationSearch[Cheap Budget,[Good Location]]
Observation 1:                                                        Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.
Thought 2: I have gathered a list of accommodations available within a cheap budget that are located in good areas. Next, I will look for Indian restaurants that meet the specified criteria of good flavor and good value.
Action 2: RestaurantSearch[Cheap Budget, Indian, [Good Flavor, Good Value]]
Observation 2:                                   Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.
Thought 3: I have collected a good list of Indian restaurants offering good flavor and good value within a cheap budget. Now, I will proceed to gather information on activity-oriented attractions that fit the budget requirements.
Action 3: AttractionSearch[Cheap budget,[Activity Oriented]]
Observation 3:                                            Masked due to limited length. Make sure the data has been written in Notebook.
